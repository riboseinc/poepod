= Poepod

Poepod is a Ruby gem that streamlines the process of preparing code for analysis
by Poe. It offers two main features: concatenating multiple files into a single
text file, and wrapping gem contents including unstaged files. These features
are particularly useful for developers who want to quickly gather code for
review, analysis, or submission to AI-powered coding assistants.

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'poepod'
----

And then execute:

[source,shell]
----
$ bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source,shell]
----
$ gem install poepod
----

== Usage

After installation, you can use the `poepod` command line tool:

[source,shell]
----
$ poepod help
Commands:
  poepod concat FILES [OUTPUT_FILE]  # Concatenate specified files into one text file
  poepod help [COMMAND]              # Describe available commands or one specific command
  poepod wrap GEMSPEC_PATH           # Wrap a gem based on its gemspec file
----

=== Global options

All options can be used for both `wrap` and `concat` commands:

* `--exclude`: List of patterns to exclude (default: `["node_modules/", ".git/", ".gitignore$", ".DS_Store$", "^\\..+"]`)
* `--config`: Path to configuration file
* `--include-binary`: Include binary files (encoded in MIME format)
* `--include-dot-files`: Include dot files
* `--output-file`: Output path
* `--base-dir`: Base directory for relative file paths in output
* `--include-unstaged`: Include unstaged files from `lib`, `spec`, and `test` directories (for `wrap` command only)

[source,shell]
----
$ poepod concat FILES [OUTPUT_FILE] --exclude PATTERNS --config PATH --include-binary --include-dot-files --output-file PATH --base-dir PATH
$ poepod wrap GEMSPEC_PATH --exclude PATTERNS --config PATH --include-binary --include-dot-files --output-file PATH --base-dir PATH --include-unstaged
----

=== Concatenating files

The `concat` command allows you to combine multiple files into a single text
file.

This is particularly useful when you want to review or analyze code from
multiple files in one place, or when preparing code submissions for AI-powered
coding assistants.

By default, it excludes binary files, dot files, and certain patterns like
`node_modules/` and `.git/`.

[source,shell]
----
$ poepod concat path/to/files/* output.txt
----

This will concatenate all non-binary, non-dot files from the specified path into
`output.txt`.

==== Including dot files

By default, dot files (hidden files starting with a dot) are excluded.

To include them, use the `--include-dot-files` option:

[source,shell]
----
$ poepod concat path/to/files/* output.txt --include-dot-files
----

==== Including binary files

By default, binary files are excluded to keep the output focused on readable
code.

To include binary files (encoded in MIME format), use the `--include-binary`
option:

[source,shell]
----
$ poepod concat path/to/files/* output.txt --include-binary
----

This can be useful when you need to include binary assets or compiled files in
your analysis.

==== Excluding patterns

You can exclude certain patterns using the `--exclude` option:

[source,shell]
----
$ poepod concat path/to/files/* output.txt --exclude node_modules .git build test
----

This is helpful when you want to focus on specific parts of your codebase,
excluding irrelevant or large directories.

=== Wrapping a gem

The `wrap` command creates a comprehensive snapshot of your gem, including all
files specified in the gemspec and README files. This is particularly useful for
gem developers who want to review their entire gem contents or prepare it for
submission to code review tools.

[source,shell]
----
$ poepod wrap path/to/your_gem.gemspec
----

This will create a file named `your_gem_wrapped.txt` containing all the files
specified in the gemspec, including README files.

==== Handling unstaged files

By default, unstaged files in the `lib/`, `spec/`, and `test/` directories are
not included in the wrap, but they will be listed as a warning. This default
behavior ensures that the wrapped content matches what's currently tracked in
your version control system.

However, there are cases where including unstaged files can be beneficial:

. When you're actively developing and want to include recent changes that
haven't been committed yet.

. When you're seeking feedback on work-in-progress code.

. When you want to ensure you're not missing any important files in your commit.

To include these unstaged files in the wrap:

[source,shell]
----
$ poepod wrap path/to/your_gem.gemspec --include-unstaged
----

This option allows you to capture a true snapshot of your gem's current state,
including any work in progress.

== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to
https://rubygems.org.
